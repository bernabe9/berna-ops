# Knowledge

Documents that provide context and reference material for the agent.

## Purpose

Store information that helps the agent understand your domain, preferences, and context:
- Project documentation and guidelines
- Reference materials and examples
- Company policies and standards
- Domain-specific knowledge

## Structure

Organize documents in folders by topic:

```
knowledge/
├── project/           # Project-specific docs
├── company/           # Company guidelines
├── references/        # External references
└── examples/          # Example files
```

## Adding Documents

Create markdown files (`.md`) with clear, structured content:

```markdown
# Document Title

## Overview
Brief description of what this document covers.

## Content
The main content...
```

## Tips

- Use descriptive filenames: `api-guidelines.md` not `doc1.md`
- Include examples where helpful
- Keep documents focused on one topic
- Update documents when information changes
